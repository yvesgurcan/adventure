"For projects at an early stage, I will do everything I can to carve out requirements and specifications. I'll make prototypes, just like I did at previous jobs, if it makes sense."

"I might ask a ton of questions. For example, Tailwind React sounds amazing! What kind of API does Tailwind want to expose to users once they installed the package? Does it make sense to translate classes such as `bg-blue-500` into a component like `<Bg blue={500}>` or is there a better, more elegant solution that Tailwind should look after? How are users already implementing Tailwind in their React application?"

"Once we agree on the approach, I'll be delighted to create a roadmap for the project and break it down into bite-sized and actionable work."
