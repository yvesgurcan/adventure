"I started my career around 2015," he says. "I'm not really sure how many years of experience you need before you can call yourself a senior software engineer. The fact is that I had a job at Nike where they gave me that title, so I kept it."

He pauses for a second.

"I've noticed that 'senior software engineer' is a good way to express to people in this field that I know a thing or two about web development. Since I don't have a degree in computer science, I found other ways to legitimize my professionalism and skills, like this title."

"Sometimes, I like to say that I have 5 years of professional experience and 20 years of personal experience in web development. I started programming when I was a kid, you know. I think I was like 13 or so when I created my first website. A fanpage about Doom II. It was pretty simple but I was already using CSS and... GIFs!" He smiles. "I had the `marquee` tag on the homepage, too. [Do you remember these wacky HTML tags from the 90s?](https://medium.com/@yvesgurcan/remember-marquee-and-blink-15ac3de4c790)"

"Well, I could spend hours talking about how I learnt programming and web development, but you might have other questions. What would you like to know about me?"
