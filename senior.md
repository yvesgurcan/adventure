"I started my career around 2015," he says. "I'm not really sure how many years of experience you need before you can call yourself a senior software engineer. The fact is that I had a job at Nike where they gave me that title, so I kept it."

He pauses for a second.

"I've noticed that 'senior software engineer' is a good way to express to people in this field that I know a thing or two about web development. Since I don't have a degree in computer science, I found other ways to legitimize my professionalism and skills, like this title."

"Sometimes, I like to say that I have 5 years of professional experience and 20 years of personnal experience of web development. I started programming when I was a kid, you know. I remember the first website I created was a fanpage about Doom II. I remember using the `marquee` tag on the homepage.
