"I would like to keep working for the same company on the long term. For me, contributing to an CSS framework that helps developers build beautiful applications is huge. This job sounds very appealing to me: open source, remote, and visual design. If possible, I would love to become a developer advocate at Tailwind. I've found myself pretty good at mentoring entry-level developers, giving technical presentations, and talking in public. I think there is something here that could be very valuable to Tailwind."
