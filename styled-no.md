"Essentially, with styled components, you're writing CSS. But you can use JavaScript in your components because, in reality, your CSS is just a string. It's super handy if you want to use variables and `if` statements, for example."

"The other thing that's awesome about styled components is that you're manipulating components. It's in the name! I know... component is kind of a buzz word these days. But! At least to me, components were kind of a revelation. So, as I was saying, they're components. Which means that your styled components are not really different from your other components (typically, you'd be using them in a React application). So your styled components have props, children, and they also have a HTMl tag like `div` or `button` as a base."

"Makes sense? Sorry, I don't know if the way I explained it is clear. Feel free to play with the examples I've shown you. Look at the source code."
