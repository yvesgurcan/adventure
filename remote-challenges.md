"The other thing that I found difficult about remote work is that I ended up with a client in a situation  where I was the trailblazer. You know, just like in the blog posts where they warn you about being the first and only remote worker in a company. I show different ways to do things (like opening pull requests instead of yelling "I've updated the repo" across the room and committing straight to `master`) and they get adopted, which is great. The weird thing is that the client really likes the way I work but they still strongly believes that being in the office is better than being remote."
