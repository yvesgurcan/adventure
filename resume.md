He hands you [a piece of paper](https://www.yvesgurcan.com/resume.pdf). "This is for you. Take as much time as you want reviewing it. I'll be here if you have questions." 

You start skimming the document but he interrupts you. "Oh, did you want it in a different format? I know some people prefer [.docx](https://yvesgurcan.com/resume.docx) for some reason."

You're about to respond but he interrupts you again. "My CV is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/yvesgurcan) as well and... er... nevermind. I'll let you read. Take your time. Ask me questions if you want. Or you can read it later."

You can feel his stare as you're trying to focus on the document.
