"Another thing that blows my mind is the increasing level of automation and integration in my daily work."

"I keep marvelling at tools like Jenkins for continous integration and continuous deployment. Simple things like formatting code on save with a linter like Prettier. Or even solutions like HasuraGraphQL which promise to create a backend with a database and a GraphQL API without writing a single line of code."

"Even better, AWS offers to do code reviews for you with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer, a tool using machine learning that they announced at re:Invent 2020."

"I tend to think that the job of a developer will gradually be absorbed and become more and more DevOpsy. The bulk of the work would not be to write code anymore but to monitor it as it gets written by a script. It might sound a little bit ludicrous, I know."

"Just imagine. For the next feature of Tailwind, instead of writing thousands of lines of code in your IDE, you deploy a trained model that will build the feature you want based on the history of millions of open-source repositories it found on GitHub. You run the application built by the script, see what does not work, tweak the model, and run the script again until the code written by the machine corresponds to the feature you wanted. No more coding!"
